# lmeca2300

This folder aims to gather the lmeca2300 (Advanced Numerical Method) course at UCLouvain for academic year 2020-21. First of all, clone the repository on your computer. Do it whether via the command line or manually in whatever the directory you want it to be in. Before going further, it is recommended to create a python virtual environment such that you do not intend the root directories of the compiler. In aim to that, follow the commands line down here :

	python3 -m venv .env
	source .env/bin/activate
	pip install -r requirements.txt

To launch python or to compile a python source code, launch one of command line here below :

	python
	python file.py

If you want to delete the virtual environment, simply launch in the command line :

	rm -rf .env

All along the year, some homeworks were mandatory, you'll find them in the ./homeworks/ directory.
Besides homeworks, we had a project about the Cahn Hilliard integrator. You'll find it in the ./project/ directory with more informations.
